# Json-Server-Demo
This is a demo app I create for json-server presentation.
How to get a fully working RESTful api server running in less than 30 seconds.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Notes before getting started
Install all dependencies
```
npm install
```

Install json-server globally
```
npm install -g json-server
```
## Getting Started
Run transpiler
```
npm run start
```

Run json-server (json-server uses 3000 as default port, which is the same as CRA.
You may change the port by using --port flag)
```
json-server --port 4000 db.json
```

## Built With
* Reactjs `Frontend framework`
